# ARTchive

ARTchive is an user-friendly interface in which clients are able to easily and efficiently keep track of their artwork created primarily in Adobe, such as Photoshop, but ultimately can be made from any type of file. The ARTchive program runs silently in the background while the user is working and upon each save, creates a .png file that is uploaded to a host webpage. The page provides the user with a timestamp down to the millisecond of each iterative save of progress. Along with a screenshot, each save also produces a file that lets the user to access the art from that point in time, allowing the user to go back on their progress and branch off from an earlier point in their work, if they so wish. Overall, ARTchive is a handy tool for artists and helps make the process of digital artwork all the more easier.
